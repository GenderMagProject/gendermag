  	<p>SocioEconomic Mag currently has three personas: <a href="#Abby">Dav</a>, <a href="#Pat">Ash</a>, and <a href="#Tim">Fee</a>.  This document shows the foundations behind them.</p>

  	<p>Dav and Fee are identical in several ways: They are the same age and  live in the same state, and all are equally comfortable with the technology they regularly use. Their differences are strictly derived from the socioeconomic status research on five facets: their <i>Access to Reliable Technology</i>, <i>Technology Self-Efficacy</i>, <i>Communication Literacy/Education/Culture</i>, <i>Attitudes toward Technology Risks/Privacy/Security</i>, and <i>Perceived Control and Attitude Toward Authority</i> towards new technologies. Fee's facet values are those most frequently seen in people with high SES, Dav's facet values are those frequently seen in people with low SES and are the most different from Fee's.</p>

  <i>Access to Reliable Technology</i>: Research spanning over a decade has found that people with a low-SES tend to have less access to reliable devices with reliable internet. This includes low-SES people being more likely than high-SES people to rely on shared and public devices. High-SES people tend to have better access to their own devices and reliable internet. This difference can affect a person's technology self-efficacy, perceived control, and attitudes towards technology.

    <i>Technology Self-Efficacy</i>: Self-efficacy is the belief an individual has about their ability to perform an upcoming task in order to achieve a goal. Self efficacy can be applied to many contexts. Here we use technology self efficacy, an individual’s belief in their own abilities to interact with unfamiliar technology. Self-efficacy can have numerous effects on the individual’s ultimate success with the task, including whether they blame themselves for difficulties they encounter, their willingness to persevere in the face of difficulty, and try different approaches to the problem if their first attempt fails.


<!--To solve problems, people often need to process new information, and there is extensive research reporting gender differences here too. In essence, when problem-solving, women are more statistically likely to use comprehensive information processing styles-gathering fairly complete information before proceeding-whereas men are more statistically likely to use selective styles-following the first promising information, then potentially backtracking, in "depth first" order. Each of these styles has particular advantages, but either is at a disadvantage when not supported by the problem-solving software environment. Particularly relevant here are studies tying gender differences in information processing style to software-based tasks, such as with e-commerce web sites, software-based auditing, and sensemaking in spreadsheets.-->

    <i>Communication Literacy/Education/Culture</i>: Research from both the US and Europe shows that the lower an individual's SES the lower their language literacy is likely to be. Even in their native language. Mastery of a language goes beyond grammar and standard vocabulary. It also can include the idioms, specialized vocabulary, cultural references, and sentence structring that some particular technology requires for communicating with it. Research has also pointed to more educated individuals having higher literacy than less educationed individuals across all age groups and across over 40 countries. Also, low-SES individuals tend to receive lower technology-related education than higher-SES individuals.

<!--One specific form of confidence is self-efficacy: a person's confidence about succeeding given a specific task. Self-efficacy matters to problem solving because a person's self-efficacy influences their use of cognitive strategies, amount of effort put forth, level of persistence, and strategies for coping with obstacles. Empirical data have shown that women tend statistically to have lower computer self-efficacy than men, as one would expect given phenomena like stereotype threat, and non-inclusive work environments and education practices. To date, we have been able to find self-efficacy data on only those two genders. Self-efficacy levels, in turn, affect people's behavior with technology, such as which features they choose to use and how willing they are to persist with hard-to-use features. Fortunately, features designed explicitly for diverse self-efficacy levels have been shown to be preferred by everyone.

    <i>Technology Risk/Privacy/Security</i>: Studies have shown that there are some privacy and security risks that are common across the SES strata. For example, the risk of identity theft, online financial fraud, and of hackers who might steal or take over information such as passwords. However, research also reveals that some demographic groups that are disproportionately in the low-SES strata worry even more about such risks. Some examples include, Black adults are three times as likely as white adults to have someone take over their social media or email account. Black and Hispanic Americans are more likely than White Americans to be concered about what law enforcement officals, employers, and family and friends know about them. Low-SES individuals experience other technology-related risks at a disproportionately high rate. For example, a risk particularly prevalent for low-SES individuals is that of unreliability since low-SES individuals tend to use older, less reliable devices, and less stable internet connectivity, the risk here is that technology will fail them before they can succeed at what they are trying to do with it

     <i>Perceived Control and Attitude towards Authority</i>: Perceived Control refers to an individual’s belief that they can exert influence over future events. Research has shown that low-SES populations often feel a lack of agency or control over their lives. An individual’s perception of control over their lives interacts with their attitudes toward and behaviors with authority figures. These too vary by SES. For example, many low-SES individuals are not in positions of power. This not only decreases their perceptions of control, but also comes with a requirement to comply with the dictates of authority figures. Consistent with this reality, decades of research have strongly correlated low-SES individuals' perceived lack of control with a tendency to be accommodating to authority figures. Further, low-SES individuals lack experiences, practice, and the cultural capital to interact with authority figures as their equals and are also less likely than higher-SES individuals to be overtly critical of authority figures.
