            Learn GenderMag, a unique method to find and fix gender-inclusiveness bugs in your software. 
            Gender biases are pervasive in software's "front end", 
            and can affect your product's inclusiveness, equity, and market share. These barriers tend to affect more women than others, but can affect people of any gender.  
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            The GenderMag method (Gender Inclusiveness Magnifier) is a software inspection method to enable software industry professionals to pinpoint gender-inclusiveness "bugs"&mdash;and fix them. 
            Companies who have used the method have found that the method not only makes their products more gender-inclusive, but that users of all genders can use their products more effectively. 
            For example, using it on one product completely eliminated a gender bias in usability, and improved usability for everyone. 
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            This hands-on course will teach you how to use this method to improve your organization's software and other IT.

          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            In this highly interactive course, attendees are strongly encouraged to bring their own IT projects (whether working products, design-mockups, web pages, etc.), so that you can begin to "de-bias" your own designs during the course. We will also provide a freely-downloadable mockup example of a software product, which you can de-bias instead of your own, for those who don't bring their own project. 
          </p>

                Margaret Burnett is a Distinguished Professor at Oregon State University.  
                Her research on gender inclusiveness in software-especially in software tools for 
                programming and problem-solving-spans over 15 years. This work produced the GenderMag method,
                now in use in 32 countries.  Burnett regularly presents research on gender-inclusive software 
                and speaks on this topic in companies, universities, and conferences around the world.
                She is an ACM Distinguished Speaker, an ACM Fellow, a member of the ACM CHI Academy, 
                and serves  on the Academic Alliance Advisory Board of the U.S. National Center for
                Women & Information Technology (NCWIT). <a href="http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~burnett/" target="_blank">http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~burnett/</a>

                Anita Sarma is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Oregon State University and 
                is co-director of the GenderMag project. Her research focuses on understanding how diverse 
                humans think when they work with software, and designing software that supports their diverse cognitive styles. 
                Sarma's passion is in fixing tools and processes to match how people think so as to make the people more productive, 
                and not the other way round. She leads a new research project supported by a National Science Foundation 
                on how to create gender-inclusive software. She regularly speaks on this topic in companies, universities, 
                and conferences around the world.

                Lara Letaw is a Software Engineer and Graphic Designer who left industry "temporarily" 
                to research and develop software usability innovations through her graduate work in Computer Science
                at Oregon State University. She found herself in the nation's hotbed of inclusive software design research 
                (OSU EECS) and hasn't budged since. She researches gender-inclusive software design, teaches software 
                engineering to 500+ university students each year, and was recently awarded a sole-PI grant to enhance the 
                inclusivity climate of undergraduate-level online Computer Science programs. In her spare time, she coaches
                small business owners toward technology empowerment through one-on-one training and consultation.
