  	<p>GenderMag currently has three personas: <a href="#Abby">Abi</a>, <a href="#Patricia">Pat</a>, and <a href="#Tim">Tim</a>.  This document shows the foundations behind them.</p>

  	<p>Abi, Pat, and Tim are identical in several ways: all have the same job, live in the same place, and all are equally comfortable with mathematics and with the technology they regularly use. Their differences are strictly derived from the gender research on five facets: their <i>Motivations</i> to use software, <i>Information Processing Styles</i>, <i>Computer Self-Efficacy</i>, <i>Attitudes toward Risk</i>, and style of <i>Learning</i> new technologies. Tim's facet values are those most frequently seen in men, Abi's facet values are those frequently seen in women that are the most different from Tim's, and Pat's facet values add coverage of a large fraction of people different from both Abi and Tim.</p>

  <i>Motivations</i>: Research spanning over a decade has found that women tend (statistically) to be motivated to use technology for what it enables them to accomplish, whereas men's motivations sometimes come from their enjoyment of the technology for its own sake. This difference can affect which features of problem-solving software women vs. men choose to use.

  <br><i>Sample data</i>: Figure 1 shows data from a study in <a href="#ref5">[5]</a>, which is one portion of the foundations of the Motivations facet values. In that study, about 2/3 of men and 1/3 of women were motivated by exploring next-generation technology, and this value for the Motivations facet is covered by Tim; about 1/5 of both men and women felt neutral about it (covered by the two Pats). The largest percentage of women and smallest percentage of men did not enjoy exploring next-generation technology (covered by Abi).

  	<p> <sup id="footnoteE">e</sup> <i>Information processing style</i>: To solve problems, people often need to process new information, and there is extensive research reporting gender differences here too. In essence, when problem-solving, women are more statistically likely to use comprehensive information processing styles-gathering fairly complete information before proceeding-whereas men are more statistically likely to use selective styles-following the first promising information, then potentially backtracking, in "depth first" order. Each of these styles has particular advantages, but either is at a disadvantage when not supported by the problem-solving software environment. Particularly relevant here are studies tying gender differences in information processing style to software-based tasks, such as with e-commerce web sites, software-based auditing, and sensemaking in spreadsheets.  <i>Sources</i>: [<a href="#ref7">7</a>, <a href="#ref9">9</a>, <a href="#ref18">18</a>, <a href="#ref23">23</a>, <a href="#ref25">25</a>, <a href="#ref26">26</a>, <a href="#ref29">29</a>, <a href="#ref30">30</a>, <a href="#ref31">31</a>, <a href="#ref35">35</a>, <a href="#ref37">37</a>].</p>

  	<p><sup id="footnoteG">g</sup> <i>Computer self-efficacy</i>: One specific form of confidence is self-efficacy: a person's confidence about succeeding given a specific task. Self-efficacy matters to problem solving because a person's self-efficacy influences their use of cognitive strategies, amount of effort put forth, level of persistence, and strategies for coping with obstacles. Empirical data have shown that women tend statistically to have lower computer self-efficacy than men, as one would expect given phenomena like stereotype threat, and non-inclusive work environments and education practices. Self-efficacy levels, in turn, affect people's behavior with technology, such as which features they choose to use and how willing they are to persist with hard-to-use features. Fortunately, features designed explicitly for diverse self-efficacy levels have been shown to be preferred by everyone. <i>Sources</i>: [<a href="#ref1">1</a>, <a href="#ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref5">5</a>, <a href="#ref6">6</a>, <a href="#ref15">15</a>, <a href="#ref17">17</a>, <a href="#ref19">19</a>, <a href="#ref22">22</a>, <a href="#ref27">27</a>, <a href="#ref28">28</a>, <a href="#ref32">32</a>, <a href="#ref34">34</a>, <a href="#ref38">38</a>].</p>

  	<p><sup id="footnoteH">h</sup> <i>Risk aversion</i>: Studies have shown that women tend statistically to be more risk-averse than men <a href="#ref10">[10]</a>, <a href="#ref14">[14]</a>, surveyed in <a href="#ref39">[39]</a>, and meta-analyzed in <a href="#ref12">[12]</a> -- in numerous decision-making domains, such as in ethical decisions, investment decisions, gambling decisions, health/safety decisions, career decisions, and others. In contrast, we have been unable to locate any study in any domain reporting men to be more risk-averse than women. Applying these findings on risk aversion to software usage suggests that risk aversion can impact women's decisions as to which feature sets to use.

  	<p><sup id="footnoteI">i</sup> <i>Tinkering</i>: Research across age groups and professions reports women being statistically less likely to playfully experiment ("tinker") with features new to them, compared to men. However, when women do tinker, they are more likely to reflect more in the process and thereby sometimes profit from it more than men do. Further, some men tinker excessively. One effect of these differences in tinkering behaviors is their impact on which features of software women vs. men will elect to use, especially when a design choice underlying the software product is that users will learn new features by exploring and tinkering with them. <i>Sources</i>: [<a href="#ref4">4</a>, <a href="#ref5">5</a>, <a href="#ref8">8</a>, <a href="#ref11">11</a>, <a href="#ref21">21</a>, <a href="#ref36">36</a>].</p>
